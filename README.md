## FAQ
**Q: The book covers are not loading.**
A: Ensure that the Open Library API is accessible and that the cover IDs are valid. The application uses the following URL format for cover images: `https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/{cover_id}-L.jpg`.
**Q: The search is not returning any results.**
A: Verify that the search term is not empty and that the Open Library API is functioning correctly. The API might not have results for very specific or misspelled search terms.
